Please refer to Mulesoft.com for more details.

To install and test this application please complete the following steps:

- Clone/Import - After cloning from git, import to Mule Studio "File > Import > Mule > Mule Studio Project from External Location"

- Set Install directory - Update the '/src/main/app/mule-app.properties' file with the location of the 'Testing directories' (see below) required for testing this application:

- Required test directories include:
  	- ${installDirectory}/inputFileBackup
	- ${installDirectory}/inputFiles
	- ${installDirectory}/outputFileBuenosAires
	- ${installDirectory}/outputFileDefault
	- ${installDirectory}/outputFileLondon
	- ${installDirectory}/outputFileSanFrancisco/
	
- A complete .zip (fileRoutingDemo.zip) of my testing directories, complete with example input files and a script for running (reset.sh) the tests has been included in /src/test/resources.

- The reset.sh script  (contained within fileRoutingDemo.zip) simply cleans & removes 'output files' from previous tests and copies the 'input backup' files into the 'input' directory to reset the test.
